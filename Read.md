This repository contains 4 different attachment regarding the project
1. run_analysis.R - this is the file containing the code chunks which performs 
the operation
2.codebook.md - the descriptive file for variable
3.tidydata.txt - the output file of analysis
4.Read.md - this is brief explanation of code

EXPLANATION OF CODE
